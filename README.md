# Frontend Mentor Challenge Solutions
Welcome to my repository of solutions for the challenges provided by Frontend Mentor. This collection is a showcase of my journey as a front-end developer, demonstrating my skills in turning designs into responsive, interactive, and pixel-perfect web interfaces.

## My Process
For each challenge, I follow a structured workflow to ensure high-quality results:
Design Analysis & Planning:
1. I start by carefully reviewing the challenge's design files. I then create my own implementation plan in Figma, where I deconstruct the layout, define a design system (colors, fonts, spacing), and plan my component structure. This crucial step allows me to think through the CSS and HTML structure before writing a single line of code.
2. Code Implementation: I build the project using modern, semantic HTML, responsive CSS, and interactive JavaScript. I focus on writing clean, maintainable, and accessible code.
3. Deployment: Once a solution is complete, I deploy it to a live server so it can be viewed and interacted with.

This repository serves as a living portfolio of my skills. Below you will find a list of the challenges I have completed.
